A platform that connects aspiring digital talents with entrepreneurs or small communities in need of digital products. In this initial phase, Portify simplifies collaboration by allowing verified businesses to post projects and talents to join them through a streamlined process.

## Features
- **Business Verification**: Ensures that businesses or communities are legitimate before posting their projects.
- **Project Upload**: Verified businesses can easily upload their project details to the platform.
- **Talent Registration**: Talents can sign up, log in, and fill out project-specific forms provided by the businesses.
- **Flexible Collaboration**: Communication and collaboration happen via email or other preferred methods, as decided by both parties.

## How It Works
1. **For Businesses**: 
   - Register and verify your business.
   - Upload your project details, including requirements and goals.
2. **For Talents**: 
   - Sign up and log in to browse available projects.
   - Fill out the provided form to express your interest in a project.
3. **Collaboration**: 
   - Connect directly through email or other platforms for project collaboration.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the website's interactive and dynamic UI.
- **Tailwind**: For efficient and modern CSS styling.
- **mockAPI**: Used for simulating backend API responses and handling data during development.
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and hosting the project repository.

## Vision
To create a simple yet effective platform where digital talents can build their portfolios while helping small businesses thrive in a digital environment.

## Future Plans
- **Integrated Messaging System**: Implement a built-in chat feature for seamless communication between talents and businesses.
- **Commenting System**: Allow both talents and clients to leave feedback and comments on projects, fostering collaboration and improvement.
- **Talent and Client Profiles**: Enable both talents and businesses to create detailed profiles showcasing their skills, projects, and portfolios.

- **Paid Projects for Large Companies**: Allow larger companies to upload more complex projects that require a minimum of two talents to collaborate. The payment for these projects will be collected upfront and held by the system to ensure security between both parties.
- **Revenue Sharing**: Payments for large company projects will be divided between platform development and the talents involved in the project, ensuring fair compensation for all parties.
- **Secure Payment System**: The platform will hold payments in escrow until the project is completed, ensuring trust and security for both talents and businesses.
